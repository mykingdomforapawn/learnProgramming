## What is it?
This repository is a collection of code that I wrote (and keep writing!) to consolidate knowledge and learn new programming techniques. You can find implementations of basic data structures, search/sorting algorithms, graph representations and more. I usually transfer key take-aways into [anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)  which you can find in one of [my other repositories](https://github.com/mykingdomforapawn/ankiFlashcards) as *Programming.apkg*.


## Why did I do it?
I started this repository after reading [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13/) by John Washam and partially working my way through his recommended curriculum for computer scientists. I will keep adding code to this repository here and there but due to my job and my many other intrests, it will be slow and irregular. Besides improving my programming skills significantly in the process of creating this repository, I want to use it as a sort of library to quickly access code implementation that might be useful for other projects. 

## What is in it?
### algorithmic_complexity
- Playground to experiment and compare the runtime of different algorithms
- Run *runtime_analysis.py* to calculate and plot runtimes
- Algorithms can be added to *algorithm_potpourri.py*
- Algorithms and input sizes for the analysis can be specified in *runtime_analysis.py*

### data_structures
- arrays: Run *arrray.py* to test a dynamic array implementation, operations can be added to *main()*
- linked_list/single_linked_list: Run *single_linked_list.py* to test a dynamic array implementation, operations can be added to *main()*
- linked_list/double_linked_list: Run *double_linked_list.py* to test a dynamic array implementation, operations can be added to *main()*
