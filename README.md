# learnProgramming
Code that I wrote to consolidate knowledge and learn new programming techniques.

## algorithmic_complexity
- Playground to experiment and compare the runtime of different algorithms
- Run *runtime_analysis.py* to calculate and plot runtimes
- Algorithms can be added to *algorithm_potpourri.py*
- Algorithms and input sizes for the analysis can be specified in *runtime_analysis.py*

## data_structures
- arrays: Run *arrray.py* to test a dynamic array implementation, operations can be added to *main()*
- linked_list/single_linked_list: Run *single_linked_list.py* to test a dynamic array implementation, operations can be added to *main()*
