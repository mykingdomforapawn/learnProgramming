# learnProgramming
Code that I write on my way to learn programming.

## algorithmic_complexity
- TODO: implement plotting method
- TODO: implement more algorithms
- Playground to experiment and compare the runtime of different algorithms.
- Run runtime_analysis.py to calculate and plot runtimes
- Algorithms can be added to algorithm_potpourri.py
- Algorithms and inputSizes for the analysis can be specified in runtime_analysis.py
