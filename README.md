# learnProgramming
Code that I wrote on my way to learn programming.

## algorithmic_complexity
- Playground to experiment and compare the runtime of different algorithms
- Run *runtime_analysis.py* to calculate and plot runtimes
- Algorithms can be added to *algorithm_potpourri.py*
- Algorithms and input sizes for the analysis can be specified in *runtime_analysis.py*
